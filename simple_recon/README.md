This script automates the tasks like port scanning, vulnerability discovery, subdomain enumeration etc. using nmap, nikto and recon-ng. Make sure you have them installed in your system. I made this script to help me with the recon phase of bug bounty program.

Feel free to modify the script according to your needs because this is the sequence in which I gather information about a particular website. I may add or modify to the file in future depending on new things that I learn.

Make sure that you have recon-ng,nmap and nikto before using this script.
